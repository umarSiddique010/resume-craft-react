## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cv-builder.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd cv-builder

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Architecture

The application follows a structured component-based architecture with state management through React hooks.

### Component Structure

```
src/
├── App.jsx                   # Main application component with state management
├── components/               # Reusable components
│   ├── UserInput/            # Form components
│   │   ├── Address.jsx       # Dynamic country-state-city selection
│   │   ├── BasicInformation.jsx # Profile details with photo upload
│   │   ├── CareerSummary.jsx # Professional summary
│   │   ├── Education.jsx     # Educational background
│   │   ├── Skills.jsx        # Technical skills with proficiency
│   │   ├── UserInput.jsx     # Form navigation container
│   │   └── ... (other input sections)
│   └── Display/              # Output components
│       ├── Display.jsx       # Template container with PDF export
│       ├── TemplateOne.jsx   # First resume template
│       └── TemplateTwo.jsx   # Second resume template
└── styles/                   # CSS modules and shared styles
```

### State Management

The application employs a sophisticated state management approach:

- **Centralized State** - Main state objects managed in App.jsx
- **Prop Drilling** - Passing state and handlers to child components
- **Dynamic Object Management** - Complex state structures for sections like Work Experience
- **Conditional Rendering** - Toggle visibility based on user choices

### Key Implementation Details

#### Dynamic Form Sections

```jsx
// Example of dynamic field management in WorkExperience.jsx
const addWorkExperience = () => {
  setWorkExperiencesField((wef) => [
    ...wef,
    {
      id: Date.now(),
      experienceFieldNo:
        wef.length > 0 ? wef[wef.length - 1].experienceFieldNo + 1 : 0,
      jobTitle: '',
      companyName: '',
      location: '',
      startDate: '',
      endDate: '',
      currentlyWork: false,
      achievements: '',
    },
  ]);
};
```

#### Two-Way Template Binding

```jsx
// Template switching logic in Display.jsx
const [currentTemplate, setCurrentTemplate] = useState('TemplateOne');

const templates = {
  TemplateOne: <TemplateOne {...commonProps} />,
  TemplateTwo: <TemplateTwo {...commonProps} />,
};

// Render selected template
<div className={Styles.template_parent} ref={pdfRef}>
  {templates[currentTemplate]}
</div>;
```

#### PDF Generation

```jsx
// PDF export functionality
const handleDownloadPdf = async () => {
  const element = pdfRef.current;
  if (!element) return;

  const canvas = await html2canvas(element, {
    scale: 2,
    useCORS: true,
    scrollX: 0,
    scrollY: 0,
  });

  const imgData = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
  const pdf = new jsPDF({
    orientation: 'portrait',
    unit: 'mm',
    format: 'a4',
  });

  const pageWidth = pdf.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
  const pageHeight = pdf.internal.pageSize.getHeight();

  const imgProps = pdf.getImageProperties(imgData);
  const imgWidth = imgProps.width;
  const imgHeight = imgProps.height;

  const ratio = Math.min(pageWidth / imgWidth, pageHeight / imgHeight);

  const scaledWidth = imgWidth * ratio;
  const scaledHeight = imgHeight * ratio;

  pdf.addImage(
    imgData,
    'PNG',
    (pageWidth - scaledWidth) / 2,
    0,
    scaledWidth,
    scaledHeight,
  );

  pdf.save('Your-Resume-CV-Builder.pdf');
};
```
